# COVID-19 Case Severity Analysis

### Background
Hospitals have been overcrowded with Coronavirus patients since the pandemic started. The Coronavirus is a deadly virus that has killed over 1 million worldwide and 208,000 people in the United States, and these numbers will continue to increase. Too many people are dying and we need to minimize these deaths as much as possible by prioritizing beds for the most vulnerable.  
Our goal is to produce an algorithm that can assign patients a severity level based on factors such as age, sex, race, and pre-existing conditions. This will help guide the hospitals in determining who to prioritize when there is a shortage of beds. During the semester, we hope to be able to determine which conditions will leave somebody the most vulnerable to severe complications or even death, and we hope hospitals can use this information to assign beds to those people, and in the long run, save a lot of lives. 


### **Results**


### **Discussion**
Predicting risk based on demographic information, medical background, and behavior can provide extremely valuable insight into how the COVID-19 pandemic should best be handled. At the institutional level, hospitals can use our risk predictions to determine how to most efficiently allocate the limited resources in order to minimize deaths and complications. Hospitals will be able to make well-informed, data-driven decisions for how to treat patients and what to be the most wary of. Moreover, risk prediction and a strong understanding of what factors contribute the most to COVID-19 severity can also be informative for the individual. An individual may engage in more extensive prevention behaviors if they are able to predict the severity of their illness or the illnesses of their loved ones. Additionally, as a society, we can identify those individuals who are most at risk, and take extra precautions to protect them from the virus. We hope that this increase in information will drive progress toward ending the pandemic.
