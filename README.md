# COVID-19 Case Severity Analysis   
   
### Introduction    
We are going to be analyzing how different factors affect the severity of COVID-19 in an infected patient. We will be looking primarily at pre-existing diseases, as this is theorized to increase the chance of serious illness or even death from coronavirus. In addition, we will also take into account how demographic factors like age, race, sex, and financial status affect the severity. We know that having a pre-existing disease will increase the chance of medical problems related to coronavirus, but we do not know how much each disease affects the severity. We hope this intersection of pre-existing diseases and demographics with severity of illness in COVID-19 patients will lead to insightful information about the virus.    





### **Results**


### **Discussion**
Predicting risk based on demographic information, medical background, and behavior can provide extremely valuable insight into how the COVID-19 pandemic should best be handled. At the institutional level, hospitals can use our risk predictions to determine how to most efficiently allocate the limited resources in order to minimize deaths and complications. Hospitals will be able to make well-informed, data-driven decisions for how to treat patients and what to be the most wary of. Moreover, risk prediction and a strong understanding of what factors contribute the most to COVID-19 severity can also be informative for the individual. An individual may engage in more extensive prevention behaviors if they are able to predict the severity of their illness or the illnesses of their loved ones. Additionally, as a society, we can identify those individuals who are most at risk, and take extra precautions to protect them from the virus. We hope that this increase in information will drive progress toward ending the pandemic.
