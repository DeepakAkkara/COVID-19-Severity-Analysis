## **Introduction**
We are going to be analyzing how different factors affect the severity of COVID-19 in an infected patient.
We will be looking primarily at pre-existing diseases, as this is theorized to increase the chance of
serious illness or even death from coronavirus. In addition, we will also take into account how
demographic factors like age, race, sex, and financial status affect the severity.
We know that having a pre-existing disease will increase the chance of medical problems related to coronavirus,
but we do not know how much each disease affects the severity. We hope this intersection of
pre-existing diseases and demographics with severity of illness in COVID-19 patients will lead to insightful information about the virus.    


## **Background**
Hospitals have been overcrowded with COVID patients since the pandemic started.
COVID is a deadly virus that has killed over 1 million worldwide and 208,000 people in the United States,
and these numbers will continue to increase.
Too many people are dying, so we need to minimize these deaths as much as possible by prioritizing beds for the most vulnerable.  
Our goal is to produce an algorithm that can assign patients a severity level based on factors such as age, sex, race, and pre-existing conditions.
This will help guide the hospitals in determining who to prioritize when there is a shortage of beds.
During the semester, we hope to be able to determine which conditions will leave somebody the
most vulnerable to severe complications or even death, and we hope hospitals can use this information to assign beds to those people,
and in the long run, save lives.

## **Methods**

### Unsupervised Learning
In any machine learning task, the [Curse of Dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) is
something that must be dealt with.
What this means is that as the dimensionality (or number of features in the dataset) increases,
the volume of the feature space in which we're working increases rapidly.
As a result of this, it becomes necessary to reduce the dimension into a context that we can more easily work with.
By reducing the amount of dimensions/features we have to process, we are able to analyze fewer relationships between
features and reduce the computational power needed and the likelihood of overfitting.

#### [Pair Plots](https://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.pairplot.html)
Pair plots are a useful unsupervised visualization for determining pairwise relationships among features in a dataset. We decided to create pairplots for all numerical columns in the dataset, since continuous values can be plotted much more easily on a pairplot than one-hot encoded categorical features.

#### [Correlation Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Correlation_and_dependence#Correlation_matrices)
One of the most important unsupervised techniques we used was creating a correlation matrix of all of our numerical data. This allows us to see which features are most strongly correlated with one another, helping us eliminate redundancy in the future as well as find the columns most strongly correlated with ending up in the ICU or dying.

#### [Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)
An important algorithm in dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA),
which is an unsupervised technique.
Principal component analysis works by projecting higher-dimensional spaces to lower-dimensional bases, where the new
bases correspond to the most important components of the data (hence the name principal component analysis).
Essentially, the goal of PCA is to reduce the amount of dimensions as much as possible
while keeping as much information as possible.

#### [t-SNE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-distributed_stochastic_neighbor_embedding)
t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding is another dimensionality reduction technique, typically used to provide easy 2D or 3D
visualizations of high dimensional data, which is extremely useful for interpreting results visually. It works by constructing a similarity probability distribution for each pair of points using Euclidean distance, then mapping each point into a smaller feature space that best represents the similarity distribution.

#### [K-Means Clustering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering)
We used the k-means clustering algorithm on our data after projecting into a 2D space for visualizations using t-SNE. Since we know our non-target features come from two latent classes (those who ended up in the ICU and those who didn’t), we decided to use 2 clusters and visualize the k-means clusters in the dimensionality reduced data.

### Supervised Learning:
The point of any machine learning task is to get some actionable results out of the data that we put in,
and supervised learning will help us achieve that goal.
The main methods being considered are chi-squared feature selection, decision trees, regression.

#### [Chi-Squared Feature Selection]
After conducting unsupervised analysis on the numerical data, we wanted to perform analysis on the qualitative data and determined that the chi-squared test for feature selection would be helpful in figuring out which variables are dependent with whether or not a patient lives or dies. We ran sklearn.feature_selection.chi2 on the data with the “died” feature as the target parameter and plotted the results with the highest chi-squared statistics.

#### [Decision Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree)

</p>
A decision tree is a tree-like structure which models the effects of
certain actions that lead to certain possibilities.
The goal of a decision tree is to split the classification of a certain input into groups
through a process of sequential questions or conditions.
In our case, these conditions might regard which underlying conditions individuals have.
These conditions could sort examples into different groups.

#### [Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis)

</p>
Regression analysis is a way to approximate the relationship between our dependent variable
and our independent variables.
The most basic form of regression is univariate linear regression, in which one tries to fit a straight line
that captures the relationship between one dependent and one independent variable.
In our case, we'll be trying to build an algorithm that learns the relationships between some continuous, numerical
output and the input features (different attributes of patients).
By using regression, we could be able to return some percentage chance of developing a serious illness
based on the combination of COVID-19 with other risk factors (our inputs).

## **Results**
Our ideal results will show a clear relation between severity and various demographic backgrounds.
The principal component analysis will ideally identify the comorbidities that lead to the highest severity. 
For example, we may find that COVID-19 in conjunction with heart disease may be more likely to result
in a severe case in comparison to COVID-19 in conjunction with diabetes. For the supervised portion of the project,
we expect our model to accurately predict discrete categories of severity in our training set based on other relevant patient information.

### **Unsupervised Results**
Upon downloading our dataset, which was composed of patient-by-patient data describing things like sex, age, preexisting conditions, and symptoms, the first thing we had to do was make it suitable for machine learning methods in general. This means we had to eliminate columns/features that were extraneous or unrelated to our problem. Then, we used pandas to convert our dataset into a dataframe, encoded categorical data into a one-hot format, and normalized data for use in a correlation map. Next, we moved on to performing key unsupervised learning techniques on our dataset, such as visualizations (correlation plots and heatmaps), dimensionality reduction (PCA), and clustering (K-means). These techniques provided insight into the structure of our data, what features correlated with others, what we could do to make supervised learning easier, and how the data clustered in its space.

## **Discussion**
Predicting risk based on demographic information, medical background, and behavior can provide extremely valuable insight
into how the COVID-19 pandemic should best be handled. At the institutional level, hospitals can use our risk predictions
to determine how to most efficiently allocate the limited resources in order to minimize deaths and complications.
Hospitals will be able to make well-informed, data-driven decisions for how to treat patients and what to be the most wary of.
Moreover, risk prediction and a strong understanding of what factors contribute the most to COVID-19 severity can also be informative for the individual.
An individual may engage in more extensive prevention behaviors if they are able to predict the severity of their illness or the illnesses of their loved ones.
Additionally, as a society, we can identify those individuals who are most at risk, and take extra precautions to protect them from the virus.
We hope that this increase in information will drive progress toward ending the pandemic.

### **Challenges: Unsupervised Portion**
One of our biggest challenges is that our dataset is very small and only has a little over 100 rows. We were unable to find larger datasets with de-identified patient data for free. Since we are interested in feature selection in order to determine which factors have the highest impact on COVID-19 outcomes, projecting our feature set onto a new basis using PCA may be unviable, so we will need to find an alternative method for dimensionality reduction that allows us to select the most important original features. We attempted to use a correlation matrix to identify the most heavily correlated features to eliminate, but the results were weaker than expected, potentially due to the one-hot encoded features. The one-hot encoding also made some of our initial methods, like a heatmap visualization, difficult to interpret.
