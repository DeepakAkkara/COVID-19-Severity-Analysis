In addition, we will also take into account how\r\ndemographic factors like age, race, sex, and financial status affect the severity.\r\nWe know that having a pre-existing disease will increase the chance of medical problems related to coronavirus,\r\nbut we do not know how much each disease affects the severity. We hope this intersection of\r\npre-existing diseases and demographics with severity of illness in COVID-19 patients will lead to insightful information about the virus.    \r\n\r\n\r\n## **Background**\r\nHospitals have been overcrowded with COVID patients since the pandemic started.\r\nCOVID is a deadly virus that has killed over 1 million worldwide and 208,000 people in the United States,\r\nand these numbers will continue to increase.\r\nToo many people are dying, so we need to minimize these deaths as much as possible by prioritizing beds for the most vulnerable.  \r\nOur goal is to produce an algorithm that can assign patients a severity level based on factors such as age, sex, race, and pre-existing conditions.\r\nThis will help guide the hospitals in determining who to prioritize when there is a shortage of beds.\r\nDuring the semester, we hope to be able to determine which conditions will leave somebody the\r\nmost vulnerable to severe complications or even death, and we hope hospitals can use this information to assign beds to those people,\r\nand in the long run, save lives.\r\n\r\n## **Methods**\r\n\r\n### Unsupervised Learning\r\nIn any machine learning task, the [Curse of Dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality) is\r\nsomething that must be dealt with.\r\nWhat this means is that as the dimensionality (or number of features in the dataset) increases,\r\nthe volume of the feature space in which we're working increases rapidly.\r\nAs a result of this, it becomes necessary to reduce the dimension into a context that we can more easily work with.\r\nBy reducing the amount of dimensions/features we have to process, we are able to analyze fewer relationships between\r\nfeatures and reduce the computational power needed and the likelihood of overfitting.\r\n\r\n#### [Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis)\r\nAn important algorithm in dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA),\r\nwhich is an unsupervised technique.\r\nPrincipal component analysis works by projecting higher-dimensional spaces to lower-dimensional bases, where the new\r\nbases correspond to the most important components of the data (hence the name principal component analysis).\r\nEssentially, the goal of PCA is to reduce the amount of dimensions as much as possible\r\nwhile keeping as much information as possible.\r\n\r\n### Supervised Learning:\r\nThe point of any machine learning task is to get some actionable results out of the data that we put in,\r\nand supervised learning will help us achieve that goal.\r\nThe main methods being considered are decision trees and regression.\r\n\r\n#### [Decision Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree)\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/0*YlmscpNST8MY7yzw.png\" width = 50%/>\r\n</p>\r\nA decision tree is a tree-like structure which models the effects of\r\ncertain actions that lead to certain possibilities.\r\nThe goal of a decision tree is to split the classification of a certain input into groups\r\nthrough a process of sequential questions or conditions.\r\nIn our case, these conditions might regard which underlying conditions individuals have.\r\nThese conditions could sort examples into different groups.\r\n\r\n#### [Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis)\r\n<p align=\"center\">\r\n  <img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/Linear_regression.svg/1200px-Linear_regression.svg.png\" width = 50%/>\r\n</p>\r\nRegression analysis is a way to approximate the relationship between our dependent variable\r\nand our independent variables.\r\nThe most basic form of regression is univariate linear regression, in which one tries to fit a straight line\r\nthat captures the relationship between one dependent and one independent variable.\r\nIn our case, we'll be trying to build an algorithm that learns the relationships between some continuous, numerical\r\noutput and the input features (different attributes of patients).\r\nBy using regression, we could be able to return some percentage chance of developing a serious illness\r\nbased on the combination of COVID-19 with other risk factors (our inputs).\r\n\r\n## **Results**\r\nOur ideal results will show a clear relation between severity and various demographic backgrounds.\r\nThe principal component analysis will ideally identify the comorbidities that lead to the highest severity. \r\nFor example, we may find that COVID-19 in conjunction with heart disease may be more likely to result\r\nin a severe case in comparison to COVID-19 in conjunction with diabetes. For the supervised portion of the project,\r\nwe expect our model to accurately predict discrete categories of severity in our training set based on other relevant patient information.\r\n\r\n## **Discussion**\r\nPredicting risk based on demographic information, medical background, and behavior can provide extremely valuable insight\r\ninto how the COVID-19 pandemic should best be handled. At the institutional level, hospitals can use our risk predictions\r\nto determine how to most efficiently allocate the limited resources in order to minimize deaths and complications.\r\nHospitals will be able to make well-informed, data-driven decisions for how to treat patients and what to be the most wary of.\r\nMoreover, risk prediction and a strong understanding of what factors contribute the most to COVID-19 severity can also be informative for the individual.\r\nAn individual may engage in more extensive prevention behaviors if they are able to predict the severity of their illness or the illnesses of their loved ones.\r\nAdditionally, as a society, we can identify those individuals who are most at risk, and take extra precautions to protect them from the virus.\r\nWe hope that this increase in information will drive progress toward ending the pandemic.\r\n\r\n## **References**\r\n- A.
